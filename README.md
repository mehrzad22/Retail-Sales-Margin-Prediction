# Retail-Sales-Margin-Prediction
This project aims to develop a robust regression model to predict the sales margin of different stores based on available data. The goal is to find the best regression model that maximizes the adjusted R-squared (R^2 adj) while minimizing the number of features used in the final model. Techniques such as forward selection and backward selection are explored to identify the most informative features.
Methodology
1-Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Analyze the available data, handle missing values, and perform necessary transformations to prepare the data for modeling.
2-Feature Selection: Experiment with different feature selection techniques, such as forward selection and backward selection, to identify the most important variables for predicting the sales margin.
3-Model Building and Evaluation: Develop multiple regression models, such as linear regression, polynomial regression, or tree-based models, and evaluate their performance using the adjusted R-squared (R^2 adj) metric.
4-Model Optimization: Fine-tune the selected model by adjusting hyperparameters or considering additional feature engineering techniques to further improve the model's performance.
5-Model Selection: Choose the final model based on the highest adjusted R-squared (R^2 adj) value and the number of features used, ensuring a balance between model complexity and interpretability.
